# Cubez
**Cubez** is a custom-made game framework written for C++. Its goal is to share and experiment with different performant and cache-aware algorithms in a simple game library. It currently provides a low-level interface for creating objects and executing operations over them. Future iterations will include a full object typing system, syntactic sugar, physics, sound, user input, display, and all the other fun goodies game frameworks usually have!
